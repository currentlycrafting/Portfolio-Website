## 🌫️ Neumorphism Explained

The design of this site uses **neumorphism**, also known as *soft UI*, which combines background colors, shadows, and subtle contrast to create depth while maintaining minimalism.

### 🔧 Techniques used:
- **Inset & outset box shadows** on cards, buttons, and images:
  ```css
  box-shadow: inset 2px 1px 6px rgba(218, 218, 218, 0.85),
              inset 1px 13px 11px #ffffff;
